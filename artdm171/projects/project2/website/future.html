                <p>This vast and unique area is perhaps the most spectacular part of the Ring of Fire that encircles
                    most of
                    the Pacific Ocean. It has many secrets to yield and many potentially valuable lessons that can
                    benefit
                    the rest of the world. NOAA research expeditions will continue to lead comprehensive oceanographic
                    and
                    ecological surveys of coral reefs in the Islands Unit.
                    <br><br>
                    The Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA are working with the CNMI government, Department of Defense,
                    Department of State, U.S. Coast Guard, and others to develop a monument management plan.
                    <br><br>
                    The plan will provide for public education programs, traditional access by indigenous persons,
                    scientific exploration and research, consideration of recreational fishing if it will not detract
                    from
                    the monument, and programs for monitoring and enforcement. A draft plan will be made available for
                    public review and comment.

    <p class="foot"> Extreme pressure and heat, toxic levels of dissolved metals and gases, and extreme reducing
        conditions are
        found across various Monument features. In spite of these conditions life not only exists, but thrives;
        albeit
        in forms that are uniquely suited for these specific locations.
