                <p class="one">There are many species of whales and dolphins found in the Islands Unit of the Monument.
                    Some of
                    these
                    species
                    are year-round residents of the Mariana archipelago, while others are seasonal visitors or merely
                    transit
                    through the area.
                <p class="two">
                    The researchers spotted the life forms at depths up to 6.6 miles within the Sirena Deep of the
                    Mariana
                    Trench
                    National Wildlife Refuge. Recent studies indicate that by trapping particles from the water,
                    xenophyophores can
                    concentrate high levels of lead, uranium and mercury and are thus likely highly resistant to large
                    doses
                    of
                    heavy metals. They are well suited to a life of darkness, low temperature and high pressure in the
                    deep
                    sea.

        <p class="foot"> Extreme pressure and heat, toxic levels of dissolved metals and gases, and extreme reducing
            conditions are
            found across various Monument features. In spite of these conditions life not only exists, but thrives;
            albeit
            in forms that are uniquely suited for these specific locations.
