                <p>No waters are included in the Volcanic and Trench Units, and CNMI maintains all authority for
                    managing the
                    three islands within the Islands Unit (Farallon de Pajaros or Uracas, Maug, and Asuncion) above the
                    mean low
                    water line. Presidential Proclamation 8335 established the monument in January 2009 and assigned
                    management
                    responsibility to the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce. The
                    Interior Secretary placed the Mariana Trench and Volcanic Units within the National Wildlife Refuge
                    System,
                    and delegated his management responsibility to the Fish and Wildlife Service.<br>

                    The Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has
                    primary
                    management responsibility for fishery related activities in the waters of the Islands Unit.<br>

                    The Secretaries have established a Mariana Trench Monument Advisory Council to provide advice and
                    recommendations on the development of management plans and management of the monument. The Council
                    currently
                    includes three officials of the CNMI government and one representative each from the Department of
                    Defense
                    and the U.S. Coast Guard.

        <p class="foot"> Extreme pressure and heat, toxic levels of dissolved metals and gases, and extreme reducing
            conditions are
            found across various Monument features. In spite of these conditions life not only exists, but thrives;
            albeit
            in forms that are uniquely suited for these specific locations.
