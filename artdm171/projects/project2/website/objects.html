    <p class="top-text">President George W. Bush established the monument under the authority of the Antiquities Act of
        1906, which
        protects places of historic or scientific significance. Only recently have scientists visited the realm of
        the monument, observing previously unknown biological, chemical, and geological wonders of nature.

                <p> <a class="wiki-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench">The Marina Trench </a>is the
                    deepest place on Earth, deeper than the height of Mount Everest above sea level. It is five times
                    longer than the Grand Canyon and includes some 50,532,102 acres that are virtually unknown to
                    humans.</p>

                <h2>The Volcanic Unit</h2>
                <p>an arc of undersea mud volcanoes and thermal vents – supports unusual life forms in some of the
                    harshest conditions imaginable. Here species survive in the midst of hydrothermal vents that produce
                    highly acidic and boiling water. </p>

                    sites in the world. A pool of liquid sulfur at the Daikoku submarine volcano is unique in all the
                    world. The only other known location of molten sulfur is on Io, a moon of the planet of Jupiter.

                    In the Islands Unit, unique reef habitats support marine biological communities dependent on basalt
                    rock foundations, unlike those throughout the remainder of the Pacific. These reefs and waters are
                    among the most biologically diverse in the Western Pacific and include the greatest
                    diversity of seamount and hydrothermal vent life yet discovered. They also contain one of the most
                    diverse collections of stony corals in the Western Pacific, including more than 300 species, higher
                    than any other U.S. reef area.<br>

                    The submerged caldera at Maug is one of only a few known places in the world where photosynthetic
                    and chemosynthetic communities of life co-exist. The caldera is some 1.5 miles wide and 820 feet
                    deep,
                    an unusual depth for lagoons. The lava dome in the center of the crater rises to within 65 feet of
                    the surface. Hydrothermal vents at about 475 feet in depth along the northeast side of the dome spew
                    acidic water at scalding temperatures near the coral reef that quickly ascends to the sea surface.
                    Thus, coral reefs and microbial mats are spared much of the impact of these plumes and are growing
                    nearby, complete with thriving tropical fish. As ocean acidification increases across the Earth,
                    this caldera offers scientists an opportunity to look into the future and ensure continuation of
                    coral reef communities.

                <p>The coral reef ecosystems within the Islands Unit have high numbers of apex predators, larger than
                    anywhere else along the Mariana Archipelago. One site has the highest density of sharks anywhere in
                    the Pacific, even higher than those of the remote islands of the Central Pacific.</p>

                    The
                    rare bumphead parrotfish – the largest parrotfish species – thrives in these waters. The species has
                    been depleted throughout much of its range and is included on the IUCN Red List of Threatened
                    Species.

        <p class="foot"> Extreme pressure and heat, toxic levels of dissolved metals and gases, and extreme reducing
            conditions are
            found across various Monument features. In spite of these conditions life not only exists, but thrives;
            albeit
            in forms that are uniquely suited for these specific locations.
