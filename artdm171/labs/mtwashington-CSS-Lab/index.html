        <p>Mount Washington, in New Hampshire, is the highest peak in Northeastern United States and the most
            prominent
            mountain east of the Mississippi River. Before the European settlers arrived, the natives called the
            mountain Agiocochook, or "Home of the Great Spirit". Today, it is better known as the "Home of the
            World's
            Worst Weather.”
            Mount Washington is located in the temperate climate zone but has Arctic-like conditions. Extreme cold,
            year-round snowfall, dense fog, heavy icing, and exceptional winds are some of Mount Washington's
            prominent
            features. The peak isn’t terribly high either — just 6,288 feet — yet it endures some of the planet’s
            most
            extreme weather comparable to those experienced on top of Mount Everest or on the South Pole.</p>

                    The lowest temperature ever recorded at Mount Washington's summit is −46.0 °C. Only the South Pole
                    is
                    colder. The highest wind speed recorded here was 231 miles per hour (372 km/h) which remained the
                    fastest
                    wind speed ever recorded anywhere on earth, for most of the 20th century, besting even the most
                    fierce
                    hurricanes. The peak is blasted by hurricane-force wind on an average of 110 days a year which
                    further
                    lowers the wind chill value. On January 16, 2004, the summit registered a temperature of −42.0 °C
                    and
                    sustained winds of 87.5 mph (140.8 km/h), resulting in a wind chill value of −74.77 °C.</p>

                <h2>Geographic Location</h2>
                <p>Mount Washington’s extreme weather is due to its geographic location. The peak stands on the path of
                    several
                    storms, mainly those from the Atlantic to the south, the Gulf region and Pacific Northwest. The
                    vertical
                    rise of the Presidential Range, combined with its north-south orientation, makes it a significant
                    barrier to
                    westerly winds. In the winter months, due to the relative temperature differences between the
                    Northeast
                    and
                    the Atlantic Ocean, a low-pressure system develops along the coastline which generates ferocious
                    gusts
                    of
                    wind.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>For nearly sixty-two years, Mount Washington held the world record for the fastest wind gust ever
                    recorded on
                    the surface of the Earth. On April 12, 1934, researchers at the Mount Washington Observatory
                    recorded
                    wind
                    speeds of 231 miles per hour. The record was toppled in 1996 when an unmanned instrument station in
                    Barrow
                    Island, Australia recorded a new record of 253 miles per hour during Typhoon Olivia. The primary
                    building of
                    Mount Washington Observatory built on the summit in 1932, as well as many structures of the
                    observatory,
                    are
                    actually chained to the ground to prevent these structures from being blown away.</p>

                <p>Mount Washington also receives very high levels of precipitation. Snowfall occurs almost throughout
                    the
                    year
                    averaging 280 inches a year. In February 1969, a record 49.3 inches of snow fell during a single
                    24-hour
                    period. These erratic weather condition prompted Charles Brooks, the man behind the creation of the
                    Mount
                    Washington Observatory, to call Mount Washington as "Home of the World's Worst Weather" — a slogan
                    the
                    observatory makes prominent use of.</p>

                <p>The peak and the observatory are a popular tourist spot as well. The mountain is part of a popular
                    hiking
                    area, with the Appalachian Trail crossing the summit, that brings in many adventurists to the area.
                    The
                    high
                    winds has also made the region a popular site for glider flying. For those who aren’t into hiking,
                    there
                    is
                    a cog railway that provides tourists with a train journey to the summit of Mount Washington.
                    The Tip-Top House, located near the summit, originally began as a hotel. It has walls as thick as
                    eight
                    feet
                    to keep the travelers warm inside. It is now a museum.
